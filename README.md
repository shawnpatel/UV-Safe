* Current: To provide protection, based on the userâ€™s current location, a live ultraviolet (UV) index is displayed and the user is able to initiate a reminder to reapply sunscreen. The reminder will send the user a notification every 90 minutes. The app also displays pertinent weather data such as the temperature, wind speed, and a picture representing the current weather conditions.
* Search: If the user is planning to travel, they can search for their destination to arrange the sun protection items they need to bring based on the weather conditions. The distance as well as the driving time based on historical trends in traffic is provided. If the user taps on the estimated driving time, they will receive directions to the chosen destination through the native maps apps.
* UV Vision: Using machine learning and computer vision, the user can take a picture of their skin to detect if a mole/lesion is cancerous. If detected, the app provides resources for potential steps the user can take for treatment by tapping on the prediction. The analysis is predicted using a custom built machine learning model with over 7,000 trained images of benign and cancerous moles collected from The International Skin Imaging Collaboration. The model is continuously retrained with a larger dataset of images to improve accuracy.
* Info: Helpful information (UV index chart, minimum sunscreen SPF, and recommended clothing) is provided to the user so they know how to prevent the sun from damaging their skin.
